npm v used 6.14.4

clone repo to local.

in command line, navigate to app file

run 'npm install'

run 'npm start'

In home page, try clicking on either product or customer id.
Clicking on Product (when you expand each row) will bring a modal up.
Clicking on customerId will navigate to different route showcasing the customer's past orders.

Project Goal: 
 - Get hands on experience with React and MUI
 - work on my thought process on building an application from the POV of an user.
 - Data manipulation.

If I had more time: 
1) I'd work on css styling
2) Improve user workflow as they navigate through the app. Put more time on brainstorming which app and page layout would be more useful for the users.
3) Apply more visualization. (Try different libraries for charts. IMO, MUI charts are too generalized and Simple).
4) General feature improvements such as login authentication, Ability to edit specific receipt in case of error. Connect to backend application where user can perform CRUD. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
